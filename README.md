## 📖 Quick Start

Imagine: You're trying to **fill a round hole with a square block**. It doesn't fit, it grinds, and heat is generated through friction.

That's exactly what modern physics does with our electricity.

**The Solution:** We need to stop controlling discrete systems (nature, atoms, energy) with continuous mathematics (Euler).

## 🎯 The Core Thesis in 3 Points

| **Problem** | **Cause** | **Solution** |
|---|---|---|
| 89% energy losses worldwide | Euler mathematics applied to discrete systems | 11-step addition following Fibonacci |
| LED efficiency droop | Continuous control, discrete reality | Already uses 89/11 logic → works |
| ITER plasma instability | ELMs are the 52% anomaly (89% - 37% Euler) | Resonant binding instead of brute-force cooling |
