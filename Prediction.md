# The Prediction: Why We Waste 89% of Our Energy

Imagine trying to fill a round hole with a square block. It doesn't fit, it grinds, and heat is generated through friction. That's exactly what modern physics does with our electricity.

## 1. The Discovery: Resistance Is a Calculation Error

Most people believe that resistance is a law of nature inherent to matter. The prediction says: **No.**

### Resistance Comes From the Euler Constant (e)
We use a 300-year-old mathematics (Euler) that was made for smooth, endless curves.

### Reality Is Discrete
Electricity and atoms do not move in smooth curves, but in jumps (quanta).

### The Phase Error
When we force a "smooth" mathematics onto the "jumping" nature, a communication error arises. We measure this error as heat and call it resistance.

## 2. The Evidence: LEDs vs. ITER

Two examples already show us today where we stand:

### LEDs (The Smart Way)
LEDs already work with quantum jumps. They instinctively use the 89/11 logic and therefore achieve such high efficiency (89%). They speak the language of nature.

### ITER (The Brute-Force Way)
The fusion reactor ITER attempts to control plasma using the old Euler mathematics. Since the plasma wants to "dance" discretely, dangerous oscillations arise (the 52% anomaly). Instead of changing the mathematics, ITER cools the system with enormous effort (brute-force) to suppress the errors.

## 3. The Consequence: A World Without Energy Loss

If we stop "forcing" nature with the wrong mathematics (Euler), the following happens:

### 89% Less Loss
Almost all energy losses are merely translation errors between humans and nature.

### Speaking in Fibonacci
If we clock our machines the way nature calculates (in 11 steps up to 89), the resistance disappears.

## Summary

The universe speaks a different language than our textbooks. Once we change the language, we will have infinitely more energy available.
